    <div class="about" id="about">
        <p>Albert Einstein (1879–1955) was a German-born physicist who revolutionized science with his theory of relativity. His famous equation, E = mc², demonstrated the relationship between mass and energy. In 1905, he introduced the Special Theory of Relativity, followed by the General Theory of Relativity in 1915, which explained gravity as the curvature of space-time. His work on the photoelectric effect earned him the Nobel Prize in 1921, laying the foundation for quantum mechanics. He also provided proof of atoms through his study of Brownian motion. Fleeing Nazi Germany in 1933, Einstein settled in the United States and worked at Princeton University. He played a role in warning the U.S. about nuclear weapons but later became an advocate for peace. His search for a unified field theory remained unfinished. Known for his deep curiosity and humanitarian values, Einstein's work continues to shape modern physics. He passed away on April 18, 1955, leaving an everlasting legacy</p>

                <p>It is known that Maxwell’s electrodynamics—as usually understood at the present time—when applied to moving bodies, leads to asymmetries which do not appear to be inherent in the phenomena. Take, for example, the reciprocal electrodynamic action of a magnet and a conductor. The observable phenomenon here depends only on the relative motion of the conductor and the magnet, whereas the customary view draws a sharp distinction between the two cases in which either the one or the other of these bodies is in motion. For if the magnet is in motion and the conductor at rest, there arises in the neighbourhood of the magnet an electric field with a certain definite energy, producing a current at the places where parts of the conductor are situated. But if the magnet is stationary and the conductor in motion, no electric field arises in the neighbourhood of the magnet. In the conductor, however, we find an electromotive force, to which in itself there is no corresponding energy, but which gives rise—assuming equality of relative motion in the two cases discussed—to electric currents of the same path and intensity as those produced by the electric forces in the former case. Examples of this sort, together with the unsuccessful attempts to discover any motion of the earth relatively to the “light medium,” suggest that the phenomena of electrodynamics as well as of mechanics possess no properties corresponding to the idea of absolute rest. They suggest rather that, as has already been shown to the first order of small quantities, the same laws of electrodynamics and optics will be valid for all frames of reference for which the equations of mechanics hold good.1 We will raise this conjecture (the purport of which will hereafter be called the “Principle of Relativity”) to the status of a postulate, and also introduce another postulate, which is only apparently irreconcilable with the former, namely, that light is always propagated in empty space with a definite velocity c which is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body. These two postulates suffice for the attainment of a simple and consistent theory of the electrodynamics of moving bodies based on Maxwell’s theory for stationary bodies.
